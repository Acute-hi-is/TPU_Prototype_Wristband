# TPU_Prototype_Wristband
# New 3D printed Prototype

New prototypes were designed in Fusion 360. The inspiration for the prototypes is a simple wristwatch which, printed in a Prusa MK4 with TPU material from Add North (FilaFlex).

The design principles at date were as such: (20.6.2024)
1. That the wrist band would need to fit neatly on a variety of test subjects, from wrist to elbow. For the prototypes, a maximum circumference of an arm around elbow was determined to be around 30cm.
2. The prototypes would need to fit on a Prusa MK4 build plate, which measures at 210mm x 250mm.
3. The prototypes would need to be able to comfortable house the Lofelt 5 actuators we've been using this far.
4. The prototypes would need to fit snugly at a test subjects arm, preferably in a grid of atleast 3x3.

For future designs we will need to think about wiring, securing the actuators better, and more.


## Prototype 1

Prototype 1 was designed with the rough idea in mind. It was printed with 245°C first layer nozzle temp and 250°C for following layers. I couldnt find any design files for this version, and its not very relevant.

The item was printed laying "flat" on the bed, tilted sideways to utilize maximum bed dimensions. As seen on the picture, the prototype was too stiff, so the chamber meant to house the actuator bent out of place.

## Prototype 2

Prototype 2 was designed to mitigate the chamber bending, and a wristwatch "nub" was added, in the hopes that the user might be able to fasten the band like a wrist watch.

This proved better for the chamber, but the band it self wasn't as elastic as was hoped. For that reason the tightening of the band was underwhelming. The "nubs" also proved to not be reliable as a fastening mechanism.

## Prototype 3

We discovered that the material used (TPU) was not very elastic, but quite flexible but willing to return to its original (3D printed) posture. We decited that it might prove practical to design the object with a type of spring effect.

We had done some test with printing the prototype oriented the same way as the previous ones, but then the layer adhesion was horrible, and the prototypes tore apart easily.

So we ended up 3D printing the designs on their side.

This worked quite nicely.

We also designed a clamp, to fasten the flaps togeather.

## Prototype 4

Finally, we wanted to see if we could make a grid, simmilar in function to the ones we had previously. I designed a band in fusion, with 3 chambers for an actuator. The spacing between the actuator housing is from previously used prototypes, roughly 30mm when streached, but 15mm when loose.
